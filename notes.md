* Players represent covenants of the tribunal 
* Goal is to collect some value of a number of different resources 
  - Resource ideas: grogs, vis, books, votes, influence
* Tribunal also faces a random supernatural threat
  - Threat must be defeated in time for there to be a winner, everyone can lose
  - Threats come in varying difficulty
  - Some threats may be so tough that the game becomes cooperative as all players try to not lose
  - Nature of threat is revealed over time? Maybe three parts make up the threat, each revealed as game progresses. 
* Players can choose their own victory conditions? Have a starting set to choose from for new players. 
* Board keeps track of time, resources available. Players can only collect resources from associated location?
* Random events (cards) affect resources available that turn or those already held by players. (Grogs called to fight monster or procedural vote drains votes.) One kind of event: certam√©n, duel another player to gain some of their resources. So need a way to measure relative power. Can spend vis to aid duel. 
  - Card effect: Someone in your covenant is working for the adversary. Max spends to defeat are reduced. Can lose votes/influence to expel.
